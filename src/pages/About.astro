    I'm Mark Resma Dacurawat, a passionate and driven Software Engineer with a
    fresh perspective and a strong foundation in modern web development. As a
    recent college graduate, I specialize in crafting responsive and dynamic web
    applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. My toolkit includes
    powerful frameworks like React, Laravel, Tailwind CSS, and Express, allowing
    me to build both sleek frontends and solid backends. I'm also comfortable
    with tools like Git, Figma, and VS Code, which I use to streamline my
    workflow and bring ideas to life. I'm excited to grow as a developer, take
    on new challenges, and contribute to meaningful, user-centered projects.
